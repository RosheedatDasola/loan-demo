# Loan Eligibility Prediction System

## Overview
This project is a machine learning application that predicts whether a loan applicant is eligible for a loan based on their details. The aim is to automate the loan approval process and make it faster, more consistent, and less biased.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Streamlit (for deployment)

## Dataset
The dataset contains applicant information such as gender, marital status, education, income, loan amount, and credit history. The target variable is **Loan Status** (Approved or Not Approved).

## Process
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values  
   - Encoded categorical variables  
   - Scaled numerical features  

2. **Model Training**  
   - Trained a Logistic Regression model  
   - Evaluated accuracy and performance metrics  

3. **Deployment**  
   - Built an interactive web app using Streamlit  
   - Users can input loan details and receive instant predictions  

## Results
- Achieved 84% accuracy on the test dataset  
- Developed a Streamlit app that provides real-time loan eligibility predictions
